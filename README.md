# This is our final project for NEOLAND
I think we have our teachers Pedro Lerida Nieto and Laura Sanchez Gonzalez <br>
to thank for the immense help and guidance they've provided us with. <br>
Needless to say, that we are all absolutely grateful for the opportunity<br>
to meet fellow programmers and for having given our life a 360, with the help <br>
of our teammates and families. 
You can check the displayed project <a href='https://connect-a-mate.vercel.app/'>here</a>.
